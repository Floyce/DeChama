# DeChama: Because Trusting Your Cousin with the Money is So 2010.

Welcome to **DeChama**, the decentralized platform that takes the "drama" out of your "Chama". We are revolutionizing traditional savings circles (Chamas) by putting them on the blockchain. Why? Because math doesn't lie, but Dave from accounting might.

## What is this thing?

DeChama is a platform that lets you create, manage, and participate in savings circles using Bitcoin (via Stacks). It's transparent, secure, and ensures that when it's your turn to eat, the pot helps you feast, not famine.

We handle the messy stuff—ledger tracking, contribution windows, voting on loans—so you can focus on the important stuff: arguing about where to meet for lunch.

## Key Features

### Hybrid Authentication (The "Best of Both Worlds" Part)
*   **Email & Password:** Log in like a normal person. No need to memorize 24 words just to see if your friends paid up.
*   **Wallet Integration:** When money moves, we use real crypto wallets (Leather, Xverse). Secure, verifiable, and cooler than a bank app.
*   **Referral System:** Bring your friends. If they behave, great. If not, at least you got a referral bonus.

### The Chama Wizard
A 6-step wizard that holds your hand while you set up your empire... err, savings group.
1.  **Basic Info:** Name your group something professional, or not. We don't judge.
2.  **Members:** Invite the crew.
3.  **Financial Rules:** Decide how much everyone pays and when.
4.  **Loan Settings:** Want to lend money? Set the interest rates here.
5.  **Governance:** Democracy is hard, but clicking "Vote" is easy.
6.  **Deploy:** One click and your rules are etched in digital stone (smart contracts).

### Dashboard of Truth
*   **Real-time Overview:** See exactly how much money is in the pot.
*   **Public Shame (sort of):** See who has paid and who is "Pending". Peer pressure is a powerful financial tool.
*   **Activity Feed:** A verified history of everything that happened. No "I sent it yesterday" excuses.

## Tech Stack (For the nerds)
*   **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite (Blazingly fast, obviously).
*   **UI:** Chakra UI with a custom purple theme that looks expensive.
*   **State:** React Context API (because Redux is too much paperwork).
*   **Blockchain:** Stacks.js. Bitcoin security, smart contract flexibility.
